                    During the late 1960s, after graduating from UC Davis (BA, 1966; MA, 1967) and moving to New 
                    York, Stephen Kaltenbach established a reputation in the emerging international field of 
                    Conceptual art. But in 1970, just as he was achieving career success, Kaltenbach abruptly
                    withdrew to California's Central Valley, appearing to abandon Conceptual work in favor of the
                    more traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his
                    "dropout," this exhibition considers Kaltenbach's engagement with time as a principal theme
                    across his remarkably diverse career, which encompasses bronze time capsules, advertisements
                    placed anonymously in Aryfpri, ,ahazome om 1968-69, and the monumental photorealist
                    painting Portrait of My Father (1972-79)
